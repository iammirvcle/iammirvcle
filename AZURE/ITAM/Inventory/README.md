# üì¶ Inventory Script Lab

## üìå Overview
This lab demonstrates how to collect and track **IT asset inventory** using PowerShell scripts.  
It covers both **endpoint inventory** (hardware, OS, applications, BitLocker, users) and **Azure resource inventory** (cloud resources by subscription or resource group).  

The outputs are **JSON** (detailed) and **CSV** (summary), making them easy to archive, audit, or upload into an ITAM system.



## üß© Lab Objectives
- Collect endpoint inventory (hardware, OS, network, apps, BitLocker)  
- Collect Azure subscription or resource group inventory  
- Save outputs in JSON + CSV for easy reporting  
- Optionally upload results to **Azure Storage** using a SAS token
