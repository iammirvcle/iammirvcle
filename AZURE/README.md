## ‚úÖ Outcomes (examples)
- Provisioned Windows/Linux VMs on **B1s**, enabled platform metrics & **VM Insights**, captured CPU/Network/Disk charts.
- Secured secrets in **Key Vault** and demonstrated **versioned rotation**.
- Set a **monthly budget** with 50/80/100% email alerts to prevent surprise spend.
- Improved endpoint hygiene with **Defender/Firewall checks**, **failed logon triage**, **file integrity drift** detection, **patch age** flags, and **service self-heal**.
- Standardized provisioning via **inventory collection**, **winget installer**, and **Terraform** for reproducible Azure resources.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run the scripts (PowerShell)
Most scripts write artifacts to an `output/` folder.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass -Force
# then cd into a project folder (e.g., ./inventory) and run the .ps1
