# Oracle OCI – Cloud Guard Quick Start

Enable **Cloud Guard** in your tenancy, target your root compartment, and review findings.

## Steps (Console)
1. Security → **Cloud Guard** → Enable (select **Target** = root compartment).
2. Choose **Detector recipe** defaults and **Responder recipe** (read-only at first).
3. Wait for findings, then open **Dashboard** → review active problems (e.g., public buckets, weak policies).
4. Capture screenshots: Dashboard and a sample Problem detail.

## Outcome (example)
Enabled Cloud Guard and surfaced 1–2 baseline findings in the tenancy, demonstrating posture visibility and next steps for remediation.
